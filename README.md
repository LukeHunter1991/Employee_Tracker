 ## Description
 I created a program to track and manage employees in a company from the Command Line. This program utilises javaScript and postgres SQL to update and retieve data from a database holding tables for Department, Role, and Employee. I did this to gain a deeper unbderstanding of using a SQL to manage tables of data.
